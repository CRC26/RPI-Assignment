# RPI-Assignment
computer systems project using the RPI

In this assignment I used our computer system labs to create a classroom camera. 
Using SSH over my network wifi I programmed my raspberry pi to take photos after a button is pressed.
The rpi then sends the photos to a firebase storage and database. 
A glitch app updates the last photo taken and displays.
